Swap 2 Numbers

Instructions:
1. Declare two variables with initial values (e.g., let a = 5; let b = 10;).
2. Swap the values of these two variables without using a third variable.
3. Print the values of the variables before and after swapping to the console.
4. Ensure the program works for any initial values assigned to the variables.
